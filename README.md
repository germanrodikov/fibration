### Description of Key Components:

**Data Availability:**

All contract state data (e.g., `currentStateHash`) is available for viewing and verification. The contract ensures the constant availability of the state hash, which can be verified through Hedera.

**State Management:**

The contract manages state transitions via the `updateState` function, which updates the state hash and logs it on Hedera.

**Logging State Transitions:**

The internal `logStateTransition` function invokes the Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) to record the state and timestamp. This ensures the verification and availability of data for each state change.

**Anchoring State:**

The contract records the state hash and timestamp on Hedera via HCS, allowing this data to be used for state verification and recovery.

### How It Works:

1. **Initialization:** Upon contract deployment, an initial state hash is generated based on the timestamp and the sender's address.
2. **State Update:** When the state is updated via `updateState`, a new hash is created and logged on Hedera via HCS.
3. **Logging:** All state transition information is recorded as an event and is also sent to HCS for permanent storage and subsequent verification.
